1. SUMMARY : In this project, I transformed given data into a scalable  database for Greenspot Grocer.
            The solution enhances clients data management capabilities improves data accuracy and streamlines operations.
2. SOLUTION :  Initially, I examined the sample data to identify logical groupings and relationships, subsequently designing a database schema using MySQL Workbench.
            I then created tables for Vendors, Items, Customers, and Sales, ensuring proper primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
            Additionally, I developed SQL queries to validate the database design, demonstrating the ability to join tables and retrieve comprehensive business insights.
3. APPROACH : I transformed spreadsheet data into a relational database for Greenspot Grocer. First, I examined the data to identify logical groupings and relationships, then designed a database schema in MySQL Workbench with tables for Vendors, Items, Customers, and Sales. 
            I validated the design with SQL queries to join tables and retrieve business insights, enhancing data management, scalability, and operational efficiency.
